### Purpose of this App

This app is designed to help you prepare for JavaScript-based interviews by providing examples of interview questions that have been asked in the past. It aims to give you a comprehensive understanding of the types of questions you might encounter and how to approach them effectively.

### Example Interview Questions

#### Question 1: Explain event delegation in JavaScript.
Event delegation is a technique involving event propagation to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. This is particularly useful for handling events on dynamically added elements.

```javascript
document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (event.target && event.target.matches('button.className')) {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  }
});
```

#### Question 2: What is a closure in JavaScript?
A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  let outerVariable = 'I am from outer scope';
  return function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  };
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); // Output: I am from outer scope
```
