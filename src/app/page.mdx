Throughout my career, I've specialized in developing responsive, user-centric interfaces and leading innovative software projects. My journey in the tech industry has been driven by a passion for creating seamless user experiences and a commitment to continuous learning.

Having worked on various projects, from developing a peer-to-peer recognition app to optimizing e-commerce sites, I've encountered numerous technical challenges and interview scenarios.
